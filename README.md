# IMLLA-FinalProject
Repository for the final project for Introduction for Machine Learning for Linguistics Applications

## Project proposal

Full description of the project is available on Google Docs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cfPv_zhlnV8oHgj630l0FwApVC4BhZqme6AO02B6pac

## Workflow documentation
1. Joint work: creation of reference tables with job titles (reference dictionary: resources)
2. Monika worked on type 1 examples from NKJP using tokenization – most of type 1 examples were annotated by her (referenece directory: examples_monika)
3. Ariel worked on some type 1 examples from NKJP using regexes and added type 0 examples: some of them were found in NKJP while cleaning type 1 examples, the rest was added from Wikipedia using scraper from week 7 and by copying and pasting short novels from WolneLektury into a txt file (referenece directories: raw_examples_ariel, cleaned_examples_ariel)
4. After making sure the examples properly coded (no job titles in type 0 examples!) and the proportions are correct, Ariel compiled the data into one dataset and pushed it to Hugging Face (reference dictionnary: dataset)
